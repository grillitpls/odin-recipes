    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Eggplants: Rinse the eggplants under cold water, dry them with paper towels, and cut each in half lengthwise.

        <li>Salt the Eggplants: Place the eggplant halves onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil, cut side facing up. Season them with an even, single layer of kosher salt to draw out excess moisture. Let them sit for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Set the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Prepare for Roasting: Gently squeeze the extra moisture from the eggplant halves over a sink or large bowl, and pat them dry with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Dry them off: Using a sheet of paper towel, pat dry each half of eggplant.</li>
        <li>Lightly Oil: Brush eggplant halves evenly with olive oil and arrange them on the rimmed baking sheet, cut surfaces facing down.</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake the eggplant slices in the hot oven for 45-60 minutes, or until the eggplant turns golden brown and collapses. Remove the caramelized eggplant halves from the oven and let them cool for 20 minutes.</li>
