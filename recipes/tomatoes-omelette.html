    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Large Eggs – I prefer pasture-raised free-range eggs.</li>
        <li>Olive Oil – Pick your favorite flavor. I like light-flavored extra-virgin olive oil for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Basil Leaves</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preparation</strong>
            <p>First, crack eggs in a mixing bowl, add salt and pepper, and using a fork, beat the egg.</p>

            <p>Set aside in the fridge while cooking the omelette filling.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cooking The Tomato Filling</strong>
            <p>Warm a non-stick frying pan over medium heat with olive oil. Add the whole cherry tomatoes and crushed garlic.</p>

            <p>Stir, then cover, reduce heat, and cook until the tomato skin bursts out and turns golden brown.</p>

            <p>Remove the omelette from the pan and set it aside on a plate covered with a piece of foil to keep warm.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cooking The Omelette</strong>
            <p>Now, rub the nonstick skillet with absorbent paper to clean it roughly. No need to change the pan or clean it under water.</p>
            <p>Add the remaining olive oil, and tilt the pan to spread the oil all over the surface.</p>
            <p>Then, pour the beaten eggs from the previous step, and cook it for 2 to 3 minutes until the sides are set and dry out.</p>
            <p>The side of the omelette should start to lift from the sides of the pan while the center still looks like uncooked eggs.</p>
            <p>Push the side of the omelette with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to let the uncooked eggs run under, and keep cooking until the center of the omelette is half-cooked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add Omelette Toppings</strong>
            <p>Now, add half the Parmesan cheese to one half of the omelette, top it with the cooked tomatoes, and add the remaining Parmesan cheese.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle some finely chopped fresh basil leaves or whole tiny basil leaves</p>
            <p>Fold the omelette in half, and cook until the cheese has fully melted.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serving</strong>
            <p>Serve the tomato omelette with a drizzle of balsamic reduction. This adds a sweet and sour flavor, almost like a Caprese salad.</p>
            <p>The best sides to this tomato omelette are some roasted vegetables or toasted bread. We love some:
                <ul>
                    <li>Oven-Roasted Potatoes</li>
                    <li>Roasted Zucchini – This goes so well with the tomato flavors for a summer breakfast.</li>
                    <li>English Muffins</li>
                    <li>Toasted Whole Bread</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
